### *Mobile Notifications

The web app supports notifications on mobile devices. However, due to the nature of web applications, notifications work differently than in native apps. Here's how to set up and use notifications:

#### Setting Up Notifications

1. Open the app from your home screen.
2. When prompted, allow notifications for the app.
3. In the app's settings (sidebar), set your preferred notification interval.

#### How Notifications Work

- Notifications are tied to your browser and only work when the device is awake.
- The app doesn't need to be open, but the browser process should be running in the background.
- Notifications may not be precisely timed due to mobile OS restrictions on background processes.

#### Best Practices for Receiving Notifications

1. Keep the app installed on your home screen.
2. Occasionally open the app to refresh the notification schedule.
3. Ensure your browser (e.g., Chrome) is allowed to run in the background.
4. Check your device's battery optimization settings and consider excluding the browser app if notifications are inconsistent.
